Container-Presenter pattern helps in separating the logic and the UI components.

Why apply this pattern?

- Separation of Concerns: Container components handle logic and data-fetching. On the other hand, presenter component only render UI and doesn't handle any state or data-fetching.
- Reusability: Presenter components can be reused across different part of app
- Testability: Pure UI components are easier to unit test
